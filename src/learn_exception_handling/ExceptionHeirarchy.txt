Exception Hierarchy:

The topmost class in Exception Hierarchy is Throwable from java.lang

It has 2 subclasses: Error and Exception

1. Error:
	It indicates resource exhaustion in JVM. It is rare but fatal. It is not under the
	control of a developer. Eg - power-failure.

2. Exception:
	It is frequent but not fatal. It is under the control of a developer.

Types of Exceptions:
	Exceptions are divided into 2 types:

		1. Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions)
			These are the exceptions for which compiler does not enforce to handle them.
			These exceptions are expressed using a predefined class: RuntimeException
			Any class descended from RuntimeException is a runtime exception or unchecked
			exception.
			E.g.
				ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, NullPointerException etc.
		2. Checked Exceptions
			These are the exceptions for which compiler enforces to handle them otherwise
			compilation error gets generated. (mandatory to handle)

			Any class which is not a descendant of RuntimeException is a checked exception.
			E.g.
				FileNotFoundException
